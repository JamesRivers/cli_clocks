# cli_clocks
cli clocks - world clocks script for both zsh and bash

I am constantly on calls most of the day and or needing to set up calls all times of the day. 
But I am also working all the time in the terminal, so I created this cli world clocks shell. 

Clone the repo, or copy the shell and run.
